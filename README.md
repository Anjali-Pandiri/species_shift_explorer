# Species Shift Explorer

Explore how species distribution are changing across time and space using Smithsonian biodiversity and climate datasets.

## Project Goal

To build an interactive, open-source tool that visualizes shifts in species observations over time using geospatial and climate-linked data, enabling researchers and the public to explore the intersection pf biodiversity and environmental change.

## Key Features

- GIS mapping of species shifts
- Time-series trends and seasonal variations
- Integration with Smithsonian biodiversity APIs
- Exploratory data analysis + clustering
- Interactive dashboards (Plotly/ Folium/ Streamlit)

## Structure

- 'data/' - Raw and cleaned data files
- 'notebooks/' - Data wrangling, analysis and EDA
- 'scripts/' - Reusable Python functions for data handling
- 'dashboards/' - UI logic and app backend
- 'results/' - Final visuals and exports
